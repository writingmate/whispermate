- do not build dmg and tag unless i ask, commit periodically but don't bump the version
- use HIG best practices as much as possible, don't design custom componets
- be very conservative with versions, keep it in 0.0.6 unless explicitly told
- The Release build needs hardened runtime and shouldn't include the get-task-allow entitlement.
