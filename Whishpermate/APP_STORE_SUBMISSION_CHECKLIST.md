## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No profiles found"
**Solution**: Create App Store provisioning profiles in Apple Developer portal, download, and install in Xcode.

### Issue: "Build rejected - crashes on launch"
**Solution**: Test thoroughly on actual devices (not just simulator), check for missing frameworks or resources.

### Issue: "Privacy policy URL not accessible"
**Solution**: Ensure privacy policy is hosted at a public URL that's accessible without login.

### Issue: "Keyboard extension not working"
**Solution**: Verify entitlements, app groups, and proper bundle ID configuration.

### Issue: "Binary rejected due to metadata issues"
**Solution**: Review guideline violations in rejection email, update metadata, resubmit (no new build needed).
