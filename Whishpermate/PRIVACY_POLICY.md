# WhisperMate Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: November 5, 2025
**Last Updated**: November 5, 2025

## Introduction

WhisperMate ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our WhisperMate mobile application (the "App").

Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the App.

## Information We Collect

### Audio Recordings

WhisperMate records your voice when you use the voice-to-text feature. This audio is:
- **Temporarily processed** to convert speech to text
- **Transmitted securely** to our transcription service provider
- **Not stored** on our servers after transcription is complete
- **Not used** for any purpose other than providing you the transcription service

### Usage Data

We may collect limited, anonymous usage data including:
- Feature usage statistics (e.g., which features are used most)
- Error logs and crash reports
- Performance metrics

This data is collected solely to improve the App and is completely anonymous - we cannot identify individual users.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

We explicitly do NOT collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Contact lists or address books
- Location data
- Photos or media files
- Device identifiers for tracking purposes
- Any data from keyboard input (when using our keyboard extension)

## How We Use Your Information

We use the audio recordings you provide solely to:
- Generate text transcriptions of your speech
- Improve transcription accuracy
- Provide the core functionality of the App

Anonymous usage data is used to:
- Fix bugs and crashes
- Improve App performance
- Understand feature usage to guide development
- Enhance user experience

## Third-Party Services

### Transcription Service Provider

We use third-party AI services to process voice recordings and generate transcriptions:
- **Provider**: Groq, OpenAI, or similar API providers (configurable)
- **Data Shared**: Audio recordings only
- **Data Retention**: Audio is not retained after transcription
- **Security**: All data is transmitted via secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS)

These providers have their own privacy policies governing their handling of data. We recommend reviewing:
- Groq Privacy Policy: https://groq.com/privacy-policy/
- OpenAI Privacy Policy: https://openai.com/privacy/

### AI Assistant Integration

When you choose to share transcriptions with third-party AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.), you are leaving our App and subject to those services' privacy policies. We do not control or monitor these interactions.

## Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:
- **Encryption in Transit**: All data transmitted to our servers uses TLS/SSL encryption
- **No Data at Rest**: We do not store your audio recordings or transcriptions on our servers
- **Secure APIs**: All third-party integrations use secure, authenticated connections
- **Minimal Data Collection**: We collect only what's necessary to provide the service
